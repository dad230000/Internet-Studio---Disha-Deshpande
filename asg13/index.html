      <h1>Finding My Dream UX / Design Job</h1>
      <p class="intro">My ideal career is one where I have a mix of creativity and collaboration, allowing me to combine design with research and the application of research to the design process. I want to create digital products that will be beneficial to users in their daily lives, particularly young adults and students. I believe that by developing skills in UX design, visual storytelling, and understanding users through research, I will be able to create intuitive user interfaces based on the needs of real people. I would like to continue to learn and grow by using new tools and working closely with both engineers and designers, and I would love to be able to see my ideas translated onto a computer screen. </p>
