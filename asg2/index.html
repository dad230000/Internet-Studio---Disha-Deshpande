    <h2>Part 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h3>
      <p>- Structured content is content that is intended to be organized, and broken into small, related pieces (with defined relationships) outside of any overall page layout, so it can be ready for whatever interface.<br>
         - Semantic HTML is the markup that describes those pieces with meaningful elements (like proper headings and lists), so that machines will be able to understand those relationships - and not just how things look.</p>

    <h3> Question 2: How do they work together?</h3>
      <p>- You structure the information and its relationships as structured content and use semantic HTML (and, in some cases, linked data such as at schema.org) to encode that structure in the page so that algorithms can read, excerpt, aggregate, and reuse that structure (e.g. featured snippets/voice answers).</p>

    <h3>Question 3: Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</h3>
      <p>- I believe it is important to have a clear content structure and structured semantic HTML for your webpage so the pages make sense to humans and machines. Accessible, clear structure enhances accessibility (reading order with screen readers, keyboard flow), improves search/AI discoverability (and rich results),<br>
         allows for content reuse across web, apps, voice, etc., separates content from presentation, and makes sites easier to maintain and future-proof as designs/interfaces frequently change.</p>

    <h3>Critical Web Design: Ch. 1 (pg 1-10a)</h3>
    <h3>Question 1: Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?</h3>
      <p>- I would say "reassign duty." I'd literally tell my inner critic: come back later when I'm editing stay out of brainstorming. That separation allows perfectionism to not void my first drafts, and also allows me to put my critic's judgment to use when it's actually useful. I'd also pair it with "go for good not perfect" so I ship instead of stall.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?</h3>
      <p>- Hyperbolic discounting is the tendency to preferentially take a smaller reward now and discount a larger reward later; this is a time-inconsistent preference that leads to procrastination. One counter-move he suggests is precommitment: establish commitments and constraints ahead of time, block distractions, so "now-me" cannot sabotage "future-me." In my case, the combination of weekly, fixed mini-deadlines along with a site blocker during work blocks is the most helpful.</p>
    <h3>Question 3: Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work?</h3>
      <p>- Castells lists networking power (who/what gets included), network power (power of standards/protocols), networked power (some nodes dominate), and network-making power (those who set up networks shape how others can use them). I do have network having power within my corner: I choose what I include/exclude, how to remap content, what to connect to, what metadata I reveal, and what norms I encourage - choices that position some audiences and marginalize others. But I do not <br>
        control big-platform protocols, search ranking, or hosting rules. My power is local and ethical: I can design for inclusion, accessibly, and transparency, and I can be intentional about who my site connects, and who it empowers.</p>
