  <h3>Who is Thor?</h3>

  <img src="thor.jpg" alt="" align="left" width="200" style="margin-right: 15px;">

  <p>Thor is an <strong>Asgardian god of thunder</strong>, son of Odin, and a founding member of the Avengers who wields the magical hammer Mjolnir <em>(and sometimes Stormbreaker)</em>, <br>
    granting him control over storms and flight. Known for his divine strength, durability, and combat skills, he protects the Nine Realms and Earth, though his path to heroism is marked by <br>
    banishment to Earth and learning humility. He is also the God of Thunder, wielding his powers with the legendary hammer Mjolnir and other enchanted weapons.</p>

  <p>Thor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the recorded history of the Germanic peoples, from the Roman occupation of regions of Germania, to the Germanic expansions of the Migration Period,<br>
     to his high popularity during the Viking Age, when, in the face of the process of the Christianization of Scandinavia, emblems of his hammer, <strong><em>Mj√∂lnir</em></strong>, were worn and Norse pagan personal names containing <br>
     the name of the god bear witness to his popularity.</p>
