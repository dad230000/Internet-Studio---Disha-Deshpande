    <h2>Part 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h3>
      <p>- Structured content is content that is intended to be organized, and broken into small, related pieces (with defined relationships) outside of any overall page layout, so it can be ready for whatever interface.<br>
         - Semantic HTML is the markup that describes those pieces with meaningful elements (like proper headings and lists), so that machines will be able to understand those relationships - and not just how things look.</p>

    <h3> Question 2: How do they work together?</h3>
      <p>- You structure the information and its relationships as structured content and use semantic HTML (and, in some cases, linked data such as at schema.org) to encode that structure in the page so that algorithms can read, excerpt, aggregate, and reuse that structure (e.g. featured snippets/voice answers).</p>

    <h3>Question 3: Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</h3>
      <p>- I believe it is important to have a clear content structure and structured semantic HTML for your webpage so the pages make sense to humans and machines. Accessible, clear structure enhances accessibility (reading order with screen readers, keyboard flow), improves search/AI discoverability (and rich results),<br>
         allows for content reuse across web, apps, voice, etc., separates content from presentation, and makes sites easier to maintain and future-proof as designs/interfaces frequently change.</p>
