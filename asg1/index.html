	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p>Three things I learned from the readings</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Something I learned from Chapter 0 was that design decisions can influence behavior, access, and perception. Design is not visual; it's political and ethical.</li>
		<li>The Web's Purpose Has Evolved, formerly planned for open sharing of information, the web is currently characterized primarily by commercially driven centralized sites and extraction of user data (The Wax and the Wane of the Web).</li>
		<li>Web 3.0 Is Not Hype, it is a push for decentralization and user empowerment, an attempt to give individuals more control over their data and online presence (Evolution of the Web).</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Semester Project Idea</h2>
	<p>StudyScape: Campus quite zone map</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Website that maps quiet or aesthetic study spots on or near your campus</li>
		<li>Includes filters like “outdoor,” “with outlets,” “coffee nearby,” etc.</li>
		<li>Students can rate and add photos</li>
	</ul>
