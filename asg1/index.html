	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p>Three things I learned from the readings</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Something I learned from Chapter 0 was that design decisions can influence behavior, access, and perception. Design is not visual; it's political and ethical.</li>
		<li>The Web's Purpose Has Evolved, formerly planned for open sharing of information, the web is currently characterized primarily by commercially driven centralized sites and extraction of user data (The Wax and the Wane of the Web).</li>
		<li>Web 3.0 Is Not Hype, it is a push for decentralization and user empowerment, an attempt to give individuals more control over their data and online presence (Evolution of the Web).</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Semester Project Idea</h2>
	<p>For my Semester Project I want to create a website called <strong>StudyScape</strong>, a digital map where it will help students discover aesthetic <br>
		and quite spaces on and near campus. Users will be able to browse study zones filtered by features like natural light, access to outlets, noise levels, <br>
		or nearby coffee. Users can also post photos and rate the places on the website for other students and to contribute to new locations making it easier <br>
		for everyone to find their ideal place to focus. </p>
