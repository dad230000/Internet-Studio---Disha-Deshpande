    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Partnering with a friend outside the course, I reviewed my StudyScape project—a simple website that maps quiet or visually engaging study locations on and around campus—using the Six Thinking Hats method. Below are short summaries for each hat and how the project changed afterward.
    </p>

    
    <section class="hat white">
      <h2>White Hat</h2>
      <p>
        We listed the facts and what's missing. StudyScape shows study spots with filters such as “outdoor,” “with outlets,” and “coffee nearby,” plus ratings and photo uploads. We still need info like which areas are most popular, how often students study outside, and which filters they would actually use so the design stays useful.
      </p>
    </section>

	<section class="hat red">
      <h2>Red Hat</h2>
      <p>
        We shared feelings. My friend felt good about the idea because it supports calm and focus. I felt excited and proud, but a little worried about long-term adoption. We agreed the aesthetic angle could encourage sharing because students enjoy showcasing favorite spots.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="hat black">
      <h2>Black Hat</h2>
      <p>
        We looked for risks: incorrect or messy listings without moderation, popular spots losing their quiet vibe, and possible accessibility gaps. This means I should plan simple upload rules, basic review checks, and clear accessibility notes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="hat yellow">
      <h2>Yellow Hat</h2>
      <p>
        We noted benefits: saving time and stress between classes, helping new students explore campus, and easy access because it’s web-based (no downloads). The main strengths are simplicity and real usefulness.
      </p>
    </section>
	 <section class="hat green">
      <h2>Green Hat</h2>
      <p>
        We brainstormed: a “Study Mood” filter (quiet, cozy, bright), optional crowd/noise hints, small badges for verified contributions, and short reviews or playlists for vibe. These make the site more fun while staying simple.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="hat blue">
      <h2>Blue Hat</h2>
      <p>
        We organized next steps: short student survey, low-fi wireframes, early moderation guidelines, and a calm visual style. This turns ideas into a basic plan I can follow.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="hat" style="border-left-color: var(--accent);">
      <h2>Project Evolution</h2>
      <p>
        After the conversation, I expanded StudyScape from a simple map into a small, student-led community with light moderation and accessibility notes. I will prototype the filters, test with a few students, and adjust based on feedback.
