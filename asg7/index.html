  <p class="lede"><strong>Short bio:</strong> Sir Spaghetti was born in a humble kitchen pot in Italy. Raised among marinara and parmesan, he quickly learned the art of flexibility—literally. He's long, he's strong, and he's al dente when it comes to leadership.</p>


  <p><strong>Why he would make a good ruler:</strong> Sir Spaghetti believes in unity—he never breaks under pressure and always brings people together, usually around a dinner table. He's a symbol of comfort, warmth, and delicious teamwork.</p>
