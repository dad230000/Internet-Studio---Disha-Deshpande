    <h2>Better UX Through Storytelling — How framing helps refine ideas</h2>
      <p>
      Framing my project as a story forces me to name the protagonist<em>(the specific user)</em>, the context <em>(where/when the protagonist has a solution/acts)</em>, the conflict <em>(the real problem)</em>, and the resolution <em>(how the product impacts the protagonist's world)</em>. This format provides clarity, highlights gaps in the journey, and transforms requirements into testable "scenes" <em>(setup → action → outcome)</em>. A day-in-the-life story helps me focus on the moments that matter, define success in user's terms, and develop the UI in conjunction with the emotional arc of the experience, rather than checking features.

    <h2>Meet Your Type — Establishing Typographic Hierarchy</h2>
      <p><strong>Ways to create hierarchy/emphasis:</strong> size/scale, weight (bold/light), typeface or family/variant, color and contrast,
      case (ALL CAPS vs. lowercase), position and whitespace, alignment, spacing (letter-spacing/tracking and line-height/leading),
      and consistent patterns (e.g., H1 → H2 → body) so users learn the rhythm.</p>
      <p><strong>Good example of hierarchy:</strong>
