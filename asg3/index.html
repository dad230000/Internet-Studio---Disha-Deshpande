    <h2>Better UX Through Storytelling — How framing helps refine ideas</h2>
      <p> Repurposing the project framework to a story gives me an opportunity to clarify ideas. I have to name a user, a goal, the setting, a conflict that prevents the user from achieving the goal they want, and what my product provides as a resolution to the user's conflict. Revisiting each feature as scenes <em>(setup → action → outcome)</em> helps identify gaps in the product, edge cases that I had not considered, and aspects that I can remove because they are unnecessary. It also allows me to surface and clarify the few moments that matter.  A story also helps draw out the stakes and emotions that help inform the hierarchy of content, tone, and pathways of interaction. Finally, the story helps provide testable hypotheses. Each scene is something I can prototype, test, iterate on, and measure; and it allows me to shift from a fuzzy feature list to a more circumscribed and user-focused journey.

      and consistent patterns (e.g., H1 → H2 → body) so users learn the rhythm.</p>
    <h2>Meet Your Type — Establishing Typographic Hierarchy</h2>
      <p><strong> Ways to create a hierarchy/emphasis:</strong> size/scale, weight (bold/light), typeface or family/variant, color and contrast,
      case (ALL CAPS vs. lower case), position and white space, alignment, spacing (letter-spacing/tracking and line-heights/leading), and consistent patterns (e.g., H1 → H2 → body) so that users learn the rhythm.</p>

    <h1>StudyScape — Campus Quiet Zone Map</h1>
      <p class="meta">A web app that maps quiet or aesthetic study spots on or near campus with filters like “outdoor,” “with outlets,” “coffee nearby,” and more. Students can rate spots and add photos — no downloads, just browse and go.</p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Students waste time hunting for suitable study spaces. Information about noise levels, outlets, seating, and nearby amenities is fragmented across word-of-mouth, random Reddit threads, or outdated blog posts. The result: frustration, lost study time, and overcrowding of a few well-known spots.</p>

    <h2>Audience</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Undergrad and graduate students who need quiet, reliable spaces between classes.</li>
          <li>New students and commuters unfamiliar with campus buildings or nearby cafés.</li>
          <li>Neurodivergent learners who benefit from predictable sensory environments.</li>
          <li>Study groups seeking spaces with tables, outlets, and longer open hours.</li>
        </ul>
