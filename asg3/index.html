    <h2>Better UX Through Storytelling — How framing helps refine ideas</h2>
      <p> Repurposing the project framework to a story gives me an opportunity to clarify ideas. I have to name a user, a goal, the setting, a conflict that prevents the user from achieving the goal they want, and what my product provides as a resolution to the user's conflict. Revisiting each feature as scenes <em>(setup → action → outcome)</em> helps identify gaps in the product, edge cases that I had not considered, and aspects that I can remove because they are unnecessary. It also allows me to surface and clarify the few moments that matter.  A story also helps draw out the stakes and emotions that help inform the hierarchy of content, tone, and pathways of interaction. Finally, the story helps provide testable hypotheses. Each scene is something I can prototype, test, iterate on, and measure; and it allows me to shift from a fuzzy feature list to a more circumscribed and user-focused journey.

      and consistent patterns (e.g., H1 → H2 → body) so users learn the rhythm.</p>

    <h2>Meet Your Type — Establishing Typographic Hierarchy</h2>
      <p><strong> Ways to create a hierarchy/emphasis:</strong> size/scale, weight (bold/light), typeface or family/variant, color and contrast,
      case (ALL CAPS vs. lower case), position and white space, alignment, spacing (letter-spacing/tracking and line-heights/leading), and consistent patterns (e.g., H1 → H2 → body) so that users learn the rhythm.</p>

    <h2>Part 3</h2>

    <h1>StudyScape — Campus Quiet Zone Map</h1>
      <p> A web application that serves as a map for students, showing locations of quiet, pleasant study spaces on campus or close by. The app has filters for identifying a specific study space, such as "outdoor," "with outlets," "coffee nearby," or "fridge available." Students can also rate study spaces and upload images. It is accessible as a web app, so students don't need to download anything to browse and go.</p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Students waste time searching for suitable study spaces. Students will have information about noise-levels, outlets, seating, and nearby amenities, but it is typically sourced from one-off word of mouth (often limited) or aimed at a wider audience (for example Reddit threads that orient around question/answer format), or out of date blog posts or articles; leading to overprotection for study/learning spaces, wasted study time, and of course overcrowding.</p>
   
    <div>
    <h2>Audience</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Undergraduate and graduate students that rely on space between classes for quiet and more predictable study spaces while on campus.</li>
          <li>New students or commuters that don't know most campus buildings or other spaces close by.</li>
          <li>Neurodivergent learners that benefit from predictable sensory environments.</li>
          <li>Study groups looking for spaces with tables, outlets and open longer hours.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Competition</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://coworker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coworker.com</a> – global coworking locator (broad, not campus-specific).</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.studyspaces.nyu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University study-space finders</a> – official lists with limited reviews/filters.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Maps lists</a> – good for venues, weak on noise/outlet details.</li>
          <li>Student forums (Reddit, Discord) – helpful but scattered and hard to search.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
   

    <h2>Key Messages</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Find your ideal study vibe fast — quiet, outlets, sunlight, seating, and coffee nearby.</li>
        <li>Trust student-powered ratings and photos for real-world accuracy.</li>
        <li>No app install or signup required to browse; contribute when you’re ready.</li>
        <li>Accessible filters help everyone locate comfortable, inclusive spaces.</li>
      </ul>
    
    <div>

    <h2>Call to Action</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Browse now:</strong> Search your campus and apply filters to find a spot within 30 seconds.</li>
          <li><strong>Add a spot:</strong> Share a hidden gem with a photo, noise rating, and outlet notes.</li>
          <li><strong>Rate &amp; update:</strong> Keep info fresh by upvoting accurate details and flagging changes.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h2>How to Measure Success</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> 150+ unique spots mapped on campus by mid-semester.</li>
          <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> 30% of visitors interact (filter, rate, or view a spot detail).</li>
          <li><strong>Contribution:</strong> ≥20% of users add a photo or rating within their first week.</li>
          <li><strong>Speed to value:</strong> Median time to “first suitable spot found”; 30 seconds.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Average spot accuracy rating ≥ 4/5 after 10+ reviews.</li>
        </ul>
