# asg11 — Simple Flexbox Gallery

## How to use
1. Put the folder `asg11` into your project. Your page is **index.html**.
2. Replace the five placeholder images in `images/` with your chosen characters (same filenames or update the HTML).
3. Update alt text if you change characters (accessibility).
4. Palette lives in `css/style.css` under `:root` — tweak to your taste.
5. Background is `images/bg.svg`. You can swap it for a Subtle Patterns image.

Fonts:
- Headings: Playfair Display (serif)
- Body: Inter (sans)
Both loaded via `<link>` tags from Google Fonts for simplicity.

Fluid Type:
- Implemented with CSS `clamp()` for `html`, `h1`, `h2`, and `p`.

Good luck!
